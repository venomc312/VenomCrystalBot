# Venom's Servers Bot

_As of now Crystal-Lang only runs on Linux & Mac, these intructions are for Linux!_

To build, run `shards build` in the root directory, to run navigate to the bin folder that was just created and type `chmod +x ./venombot && ./venombot`.  This command should only be used for the first startup, after that you can run just `./venombot`

If this is the first build you will have to create a `config.json` in the bin directory as well.  Here is an example config.
```json
{
    "token" : "NzcwNDQzNjIxNjM5OTEzNTAz.X5dpiQ.aWb4YBOrbCSVB-ML-bDmVgt0DzA",
    "prefix" : "*"
}
```
